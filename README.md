# The-Collatz-conjecture
## This repo contains Sedra & Hejer's attempts to solve the Collatz Conjecture problem:
*The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any positive integer n and apply the following algorithm:*

*n = n/2, if n is even*

*n = 3Ã—n+1, if n is odd*

*The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied, all positive integers will eventually reach 1. 
For example, if n = 35, the sequence is*
*35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.*

*Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this sequence in the child process. The starting number will be provided from the command line. For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. Because the parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting the program.
Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive integer is passed on the command line.* 

Any modifications are welcomed.
